    Description: This module covers the declaration
    and assignment of values to variables.
************************************************** */

/* --------------------------------------------------
    Variables are used to store values that can be
    referenced later. Variables are broken up into
    two parts:
        - Variable declaration.
        - Variable value assignment.

    Variables are declared with the word "let".
    Below is an example.
-------------------------------------------------- */

let company;
company = "Scrumfluence";



/* --------------------------------------------------
    Variables can be declared and have a value
    assigned to them in a single statment.
-------------------------------------------------- */

let jobTitle = "Junior Software Developer";



/* --------------------------------------------------
    Variables can only be declared once. However,
    they can have references or have their values
    replaced as many times as needed.

    In the example below we are replacing the value
    of "jobTitle" with a new value.
-------------------------------------------------- */

jobTitle = "Junior Software Engineer";

console.log(company);
console.log(jobTitle);
